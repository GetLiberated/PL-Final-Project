## FAQ

- **What OS is currently supported?**
   - macOS
   - Windows 10

- **What Browser is currently supported?**
   - Google Chrome
   - Safari ***(Very limited support)***

- **What happen if I don't have Google Chrome?**
   - Mac: You will use the built in browser that came with your OS (Safari)
   - Windows 10: The program will not run, please download Google Chrome.

- **What happen if I use a very limited support browser?**
   - You can't no longer use EzBimay if you want to interact with Binus Maya due to browser limitation.
   - Note: ***Even if you can, it is NOT recommended to use this browser, you will encounter difficulties when using the application with this browser.***

- **Why I can't login?**
   - Please check if you can login to Binus Maya normally on your browser, sometimes the server might be down.

- **Why Binus Maya is so slow?**
   - Maybe your internet connection speed is slow or Binus Maya server is crowded.

- **Why Binus Maya won't open?**
   - Check your internet connection or maybe Binus Maya server is currently down.

- **What does the tiny green check on the corner mean?**
   - To indicate your account is now sync with Binus Maya.

- **Why are you so racist to mac users?**
   - Due to technical limitation, I can't provide all the features to macOS version. Instead, they can use EzBimay without Google Chrome ;)

- **Will you support more browser in the future?**
   - If you search "the world most used browser" you will see that Google Chrome is the top of the chart, only to second Safari. That's why I'm not convinced and very unlikely to bring more support to other browser.

- **I'm a mac user and I demand OS equality.**
   - Fine, you win but don't blame me if it doesn't work or something broke, also you need Java 8 and Google Chrome for this  <a href="https://github.com/savageRex/EzBimay/releases/download/1.0.0/EzBimay_macos-x64.dmg" target="_blank">`one`</a>
   - Note: Don't choose deny or allow or even always allow if a Google Chrome Helper message popup. Just leave it be, drag it to the corner, done. Simple, but annoying. This is why I removed it.
